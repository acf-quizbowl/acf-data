\b0 The daughter of an internationally renowned archaeologist, she worked for an electrical engineering firm for ten years before turning to writing.  Later works include \i Men, Women, and Places\i0  and \i The Faithful Wife\i0 , and she published \i The Wild Orchid\i0  and \i The Burning Bush\i0  after her conversion to Roman Catholicism, and her continuing interest in the "immoral love" of women resulted in both \i Jenny\i0  and \i Images in a Mirror\i0 .  But she may be best-known for investigating medieval Nordic themes and her long historical novels, including \i Olav Audusson\i0  and a long work with three parts entitled \i The Garland\i0 , \i The Mistress of Husaby\i0 , and \i The Cross\i0 , respectively.

The character of the manservant Du Bois enhances the farcical nature of the play, who, in his attempt to speak to his master, says virtually nothing.  The poet Oronte wishes to make friends, but instead alienates the title character, who tells his good friend Philinte to stop flattering Oronte.  The suitors Acaste and Clitandre vie for the love of the ward of Arsinoe, who accuses the title character's love interest of flirtatiousness.

One of the servants, Bia, says nothing, while the other, Kratus insists that the title character is guilty and must be punished.

\b0 First outlined in the seminal 1960 paper "The Problem of Social Cost", it was originally considered merely a theoretical problem of no practical importance.  Developed while its creator worked at the University of Virginia in Charlottesville,  it is based on the fact that any economic problem will be judged as the fault of one party, but in fact results from joint causation.  Therefore, despite legal liability given to one party, when information and transaction costs are low, the market will resolve any nuisance without regard to the legal ruling, thus eliminating the externality.

One of the products of this reaction is very short-lived in normal matter so, in a gamma detector, one must generally infer that this reaction has taken place from the presence of an annihilation radiation spectrum about m\sub e\nosupersub c\super 2\nosupersub  [\ldblquote m-sub-e cee squared\rdblquote ].

\f3 Answer the following about Mayan mythology, FTPE.\par

\b0 It is caused by strange orbital angular geometries, which makes their electrons poor at schielding the charge of the nucleus and increases effective nuclear charge at a rate much higher than the general trend.  It explains a number of unexpected properties of certain elements, such as why molybdenum and tugsten have nearly the same atomic radius despite tungsten's having 32 more electrons, and also the extreme physical and chemical similarity of many of its namesake elements, which include the bunch discovered in Ytterby, Sweden.  FTP, name this effect caused by the properties of \i f\i0  orbitals, and named for a group of elements starting with element 57.\par

\pard\sb100\sa100\b0\f3 Cholera toxin irreversibly adds an ADP-ribosyl group to the alpha subunit of these, essentially causing permanent activation. The proteins that couple to them contain seven membrane spanning helical regions, with loops between the helices that extend into the cytosol and interact with them. Examples of such coupled receptors include rhodopsins and beta-adrenergic receptors. When activated, the alpha subunit separates and activates adenylyl cyclase, causing production of the second messenger cyclic AMP. FTP, what are these trimeric proteins important in signal transduction, named for their use of GDP and GTP as molecular regulators?\line\tab Answer: \b G protein\b0 s or \b guanine nucleotide binding protein\b0\line\line In Britain, it is referred to as its namesake's "chorea," referring to the most notable outward symptom of this disease. Onset is strongly correlated with the number of repeats of a sequence on chromosome 4, with a larger number equaling an ealier onset. An autosomal dominant disorder, the gene causing it has persisted in the human gene pool because symptoms usually do not until after the age of 30, and sometimes do not appear until after 50. Once onset occurs, however, the disease progresses quickly, causing personality changes, dementia, uncontrolled writhing before ending in death. FTP, what is this degenerative genetic disorder?\line\tab Answer: \b Huntington\b0 's disease\line\line\pard It contains nonstandard amino acids such as diaminopimelic acid and also D-amino acids. Its carbohydrate backbone consists of alternating subunits of N-acetyl glucosamine and N-acetyl muramic acid.   Vancomycin and beta-lactam antibiotics such as cephalosporin and penicillin work by inhibiting the formation of oligopeptide cross-links between chains.  The extensive crosslinking is also believed to be what traps crystal violet when Gram\rquote s stain is performed.  Also called murein, FTP, name this substance that forms the cell walls of eubacteria.\par

Predicted by Baade and Zwicky in 1933, it is estimated that as many as 100 million of these objects exist in our galaxy, but only about 1000 have been observed.  The surface of these objects is a solid crust consisting mostly of iron-56, while the interior is believed to exist as a superfluid, or possibly a quark-gluon plasma.  Some examples have magnetic fields over one billion Tesla and densities on the order of 10 to 14 grams per cubic centimeter.

\tab Answer: \b electronegativity\b0  (do not accept electron affinity)\line 2. This man introduced the concept of electronegativity in 1932, and devised an empirical scale for it that set the value for fluorine at 4.0.  He also won a couple Nobel Prizes.\par
\tab Answer: Linus \b Pauling\line\b0 3. This man developed a more quantitative formulation of electronegativity which defines it as the average of the ionization energy and the electron affinity. He may be better known today, though, for developing molecular orbital theory along with Hund.\line\tab Answer: Robert Sanderson \b Mulliken\line\b0\line Visual bonus (hand out attached sheet below to team)\line Give the names of the organic chemistry reactions shown in the pictured examples, FTPE. \par

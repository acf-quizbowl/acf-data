 The first version of his book }{\i\fs22 Theologia}{\fs22  was formally condemned and burned by a council held at Soissons. After reading the Bible and the Fathers of the Church, this man arranged his findings in a compilation entitled }{\i\fs22 
Sic et non}{\fs22 , or \'93Yes and No.\'94 As a philosopher he is known for his original use of dialectics and his solution of the problem of universals. FTP, name this famed teacher of the 12}{\fs22\super th}{\fs22

\par }{\fs22 2. The title to this group of poems was actually suggested by an earlier poem by the author entitled \'93Catrina to Camoens.\'94
 There are numerous references to Greek literature in them, such as the reminiscence of the pastoral poet Theocritus in the opening line of the first poem. In poem five, the poet compares the sadness of the Greek heroine Electra to her own hea
vy heart. Unlike previous efforts, they tell the story of a love affair from a woman\rquote s point of view. Dedicated to the poet\rquote s husband, FTP, identify this group of poems, of which number forty-three opens, \'93

o. That tyrant Pizarro has been holding Florestan, the husband of the title character, in a prison for some time. Thus, the title character changes her name, dresses as a boy, and gets a job with Rocco, the kindly caretaker of the prison. Things get confu
sing when Rocco\rquote s daughter, Marcellina falls in love with the apparently male title character, and Marcellina\rquote s admirer, Jacquino, becomes jealous. FTP, identify this opera, which was first named }{\i\fs22 Leonore}{\fs22

\par 5. Proper function of this organ is often checked via the use of such toxic substances as hippuric acid and Bromsulphalein (Brom sull fay leen). The smallest channels of its va
scular system are lined by Kuppfer cells, which work in antibody formation and ingestion of foreign particles. This organ\rquote 
s lobes are connected via the falciform ligament, and it synthesizes many serum proteins, including albumin and several clotting facto

s of an arc, and it was first calculated by British astronomer James Bradley. It is defined as the maximum amount of the apparent yearly displacement of a star or other celestial body, resulting from the Earth\rquote 
s orbital motion around the Sun. In optics sev
eral types of it exist including a spherical and chromatic form, and other varieties of this phenomenon are astigmatism, curvature of field, and distortion. FTP, what is this 10 letter word, that in optical systems, is defined as the deviation of light ra

real estate developer William Zeckendorf, he created such urban projects as the Place Ville-Marie in Montreal. After branching out on his own, notable designs included those for the Everson Museum of Art in Syracuse, N.Y. and a pentagonal control tower fo
r
 use by the FAA. He began a rebuilding project for the Louvre in 1984, but much of his work was in the northeast U.S. such as the New York City Convention Center and the JFK Memorial Library at Harvard. After founding his own firm in 1955, he might have b

t know about radioactivity. He became wealthy through his invention of a receiver for the submarine telegraph. Along with a famous friend, he discovered that when a gas is allowed to
 expand without performing external work, the temperature of that gas falls. After his ennoblement, he would gain the barony of Largs. FTP, name this man, who collaborated with James Prescott Joule, best remembered for formulating the absolute scale of te

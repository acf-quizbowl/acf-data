Equating the luminosity of one of these objects with the energy generated by its formation gives a characteristic temperature that scales as the one-fourth power of the formation rate. The Eddington limit gives the upper bound for the rate of their formation, and the formation of one of them around a black hole at the center of a galaxy gives rise to an active galactic nucleus. In cases such as those involving dwarf novae and x-ray transients, the gases in these objects behave like highly viscous fluids. These objects can be observed around protostars, and can form in binary systems when one of the stars is big enough to fill its Roche lobe, resulting in a draw of mass towards one of the stars. For ten points, identify these circular objects formed when material coalesces around a gravitational source.\par
